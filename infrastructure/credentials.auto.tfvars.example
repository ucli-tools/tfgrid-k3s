# Node IDs: Replace these with your actual node IDs from ThreeFold Grid
# Example: node configurations for different deployment sizes

# Management node ID

# Network name for the cluster
# network_name = "k3s_cluster_net"  # Name of the network for the cluster

# Management node specifications (defaults provided in main.tf)
# management_cpu = 1      # vCPU for management node
# management_mem = 2048   # MB RAM for management node (2 GB)
# management_disk = 25    # GB SSD for management node

# Optional: Set to false to deploy worker nodes without public IPv4 addresses
# worker_public_ipv4 = true  # Default is true

# Testing/Dev: 1 control + 2 workers
# control_nodes = [1000]  # Single control plane node ID
# worker_nodes  = [2000, 2001]  # Two worker node IDs

# Small Production: 3 controls + 3 workers
# control_nodes = [1000, 1001, 1002]  # Three control plane node IDs
# worker_nodes  = [2000, 2001, 2002]  # Three worker node IDs

# Medium/Large: 3 controls + 5+ workers
# control_nodes = [1000, 1001, 1002]  # Three control plane node IDs
# worker_nodes  = [2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004]  # Five worker node IDs

# Your SSH public key (leave commented out to auto-detect)
# SSH_KEY = "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2E..."
# When the line above is commented out, system will check for keys in this order:
