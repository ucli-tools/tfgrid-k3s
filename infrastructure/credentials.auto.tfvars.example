# Node IDs: Replace these with your actual node IDs from ThreeFold Grid
# Example: node configurations for different deployment sizes

# Management node ID
management_node = 1000  # Replace with your management node ID

# Management node specifications (defaults provided in main.tf)
# management_cpu = 1      # vCPU for management node
# management_mem = 2048   # MB RAM for management node (2 GB)
# management_disk = 25    # GB SSD for management node

# Optional: Set to false to deploy worker nodes without public IPv4 addresses
# worker_public_ipv4 = true  # Default is true

# Testing/Dev: 1 control + 2 workers
# control_nodes = [1000]  # Single control plane node ID
# worker_nodes  = [2000, 2001]  # Two worker node IDs

# Small Production: 3 controls + 3 workers
# control_nodes = [1000, 1001, 1002]  # Three control plane node IDs
# worker_nodes  = [2000, 2001, 2002]  # Three worker node IDs

# Medium/Large: 3 controls + 5+ workers
# control_nodes = [1000, 1001, 1002]  # Three control plane node IDs
# worker_nodes  = [2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004]  # Five worker node IDs

# Your SSH public key (leave commented out to auto-detect)
# SSH_KEY = "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2E..."
# When the line above is commented out, system will check for keys in this order:
# 1. ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# Network Configuration
# Choose your ThreeFold Grid network: main (production), test, or dev

# For main network (production):
# tfgrid_network = "main"

# For test network:
# tfgrid_network = "test"

# For dev network:
# tfgrid_network = "dev"

# Deployment Instructions
##############################################################

# 1. Set your ThreeFold mnemonic (choose one method):

# Method A: Export environment variable
# export TF_VAR_mnemonic="$(cat ~/.config/threefold/mnemonic)"

# Method B: Set and export in one command
# set -x TF_VAR_mnemonic $(cat ~/.config/threefold/mnemonic)

# Method C: Inline with deployment
# TF_VAR_mnemonic="$(cat ~/.config/threefold/mnemonic)" make infrastructure

# 2. Set network (optional, defaults to main):
# export TF_VAR_network="main"    # Production
# export TF_VAR_network="test"    # Testing
# export TF_VAR_network="dev"     # Development

# 3. Deploy complete stack:
# make infrastructure platform nextcloud

# 4. Or deploy step by step:
# make infrastructure  # Deploy VMs
# make platform       # Deploy K3s
# make app nextcloud  # Deploy Nextcloud

# 5. Configure Nextcloud application:
# cp apps/nextcloud/config.tfvars.example apps/nextcloud/config.tfvars
# nano apps/nextcloud/config.tfvars

# 6. For DNS round-robin setup (no-SPOF):
# - Get worker public IPs from infrastructure output
# - Create multiple A records pointing to each worker IP
# - Configure MetalLB for IP advertisement
# - See docs/nextcloud/dns-round-robin-setup.md for details
